## User interface text

> In the same way that it’s best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it’s best to work with a professional writer on your app’s user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app’s design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.

— Apple _[OS X Human Interface Guidelines][1]_


### UI copy

Text appears in the user interface _(or “UI”)_ in button names, menu labels, application settings, and dialogs as well as the “microcopy” in notification banners, headings and small print, navigation, feedback and error messages.

The care we take in crafting every bit of text in the app should reflect the level of detail invested in the design and user experience that sets Wire apart.

Rather than re-invent the wheel or get “creative” in ways that confuse users, we defer to existing platform conventions wherever possible.

The sections below provide resources for each platform we support.

- [Desktop](#desktop)
- [iOS](#ios)
- [Android](#android)
- [Glossary of Wire terms](#glossary-of-wire-terms)

### Desktop

When writing for the Mac desktop user interface, use the conventions that Apple has established in the [OS X Human Interface Guidelines][1].

The following sections are particularly useful:

* [Naming Menus and Items][2]
* [Terminology and Wording][3]
* [Use the Right Capitalization Style in Labels and Text][4]

**NOTE:** In June, Apple announced that their desktop operating system will be renamed from “OS X” to “macOS” with Version 10.12 (Sierra).

However, since _OS X El Capitan_ (Version 10.11) is still the current version, we’ll stick with the “OS X” terminology until the new version ships this fall. Once _macOS Sierra_ is released, we’ll change all occurrences to reflect the official name of the new “macOS”.

### iOS

When writing for iOS, refer to the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines][5], especially:

* [Terminology and Wording][6]
* [UI Elements][7]

### Android

For guidance on writing conventions for Android, see [Android Writing Style][8].

### Glossary of Wire terms

See the [draft Glossary on GitHub][9].

Feel free to suggest new terms if there’s something missing there.
