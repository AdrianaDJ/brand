<p>Our logo is a custom lettering created specially for Wire brand in collaboration between Wire Design team and illustrator Mads Burchart. Wire logo spells out the name of our product and it is always used to represent Wire as brand.</p>

<p>There are no set size limitations to the logo as it is designed to be legible even in the smallest sizes, but we do ask you to give it some room to breathe by avoiding placing objects in the safe zone around it.</p>

<p>Wire logo is also not limited to be used in specific colors, but we often prefer simple black or white depending on the background. Using it with any Wire paletter color will also work well.</p>
