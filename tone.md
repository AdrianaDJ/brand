# UI copy

> Text is prevalent throughout the [user] interface for such things as button names, menu labels, dialog messages, and help tags. Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of UI design.

> In the same way that it’s best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it’s best to work with a professional writer on your app’s user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app’s design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.

— Apple _OS X Human Interface Guidelines_

Rather than re-invent the wheel or get “creative” in ways that confuse users, we defer to existing platform conventions wherever possible.

## Mac OS X (desktop)

When writing for the Mac desktop user interface, use the conventions that Apple has established in the [OS X Human Interface Guidelines][OSX-HIG].

The following sections are particularly useful:

* [Naming Menus and Items](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/MenuNaming.html)
* [Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html)
* [Use the Right Capitalization Style in Labels and Text](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW4)

**NOTE:** In June, Apple announced that their desktop operating system will be renamed from “OS X” to “macOS” with Version 10.12 (Sierra).

However, since _OS X El Capitan_ (Version 10.11) is still the current version, we’ll stick with the “OS X” terminology until the new version ships this fall. Once _macOS Sierra_ is released, we’ll change all occurrences to reflect the official name of the new “macOS”.

## iOS

When writing for iOS, refer to the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines][iOS-HIG], especially:

* [Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/FeedbackCommunication.html)
* [UI Elements](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html)

## Android

For guidance on writing conventions for Android, see [Android Writing Style](https://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html).


# Writing guidelines

> Wire is different. It’s obvious the second you see our application in action. This is a brand that’s going to transform the way people communicate.

> Part of that transformation is evident in the way we say what we say. Our communication style underscores our challenger mentality and ensures we deliver a consistent brand experience that’s more compelling, more engaging, and more attractive than other options out there.

> Because we believe the way we look and sound on the outside is as important as the sophisticated technology we have on the inside, we’ve created these guidelines to help you develop people-centered communications that speak with a Wire “voice” and follow our style.


## Our tone of voice

Communicating our core brand values - people, craft and evolution - requires a tone of voice that is consistent at every level, yet is still flexible enough to accommodate a variety of audiences.

By speaking with a consistent voice, we ensure a seamless experience wherever people might encounter our brand, whether that’s creating user interface text in the application, an email verifying a new account, or a registration page on the website.

Think of it this way – if Wire was a person, he or she would be smart, driven and personable and those characteristics would hold true in any situation.

To ensure we reach that level of consistency across all our brand touchpoints, we must ensure our tone of voice is:

* **Contemporary** – we use contractions when it’s called for, and we may even take a few language liberties (such as starting a sentence with a conjunction or using incomplete sentences when short and to the point will do: “Forgot your password?” instead of “Did you forget your password?”). But, we avoid jargon and slang that might be “in” today but could be “out” tomorrow.
* **Direct** - we communicate in straightforward, confident language that is as honest and transparent as possible (for example, “You’ll need to add contacts before you can start a conversation” instead of “We need access to your address book to find people to start a conversation”).
* **Personable** – our words create the impression of one person (“we” at Wire) speaking with another (“you” the reader) as a friend, not a faceless “user”. However, the emphasis should always be on “you”, with less “we” or “us”.
* **Supportive** – we never blame; rather, we always offer a helpful solution or suggest a next step (for example, “Forgot your password? Retrieve it here…”, not simply an error message highlighting the obvious: “That’s the wrong password” with no link).
* **Concise** – we use active verbs whenever possible (for example, “Sami muted this conversation”, not “This conversation was muted by Sami”) and always opt for imperatives before gerunds (for example, “Use this code to link your phone”, not “Using this code will link your phone”).
* **Polite** – we’re not afraid to say “please or thank you” in instructional copy and calls to action, but we don’t overdo it and we sometimes use it to (gently) remind people.


## Our writing style

### Abbreviations
Avoid abbreviations where possible. Use “for example” or “such as” instead of “e.g.” or “that is” instead of “i.e.”. – or, better yet – edit copy to avoid these constructs entirely.

### Articles, leading or otherwise
In all UI copy, we avoid articles wherever possible. Articles include “a”, “an”, “the”, etc. In a similar vein, we also avoid demonstrative words such as “this” and “those”.

### Capitalization
We use all caps for system messages (“UNBLOCK”) in the conversation view and in certain other places as necessary to agree with (Android) platform conventions.

However, for longer phrases or sentences, we use sentence case: we only capitalize the first word of a phrase or sentence (“You’ve left this conversation”).

Headings on the website, support site, and longer documents should use case consistently _(either sentence case or title case)_ based on context.

For example, CS content at [support.wire.com](https://support.wire.com/) uses sentence case in the question list, but title case in page headings _(as required by the Zendesk customer service platform)_. Certain channels _(such as press releases)_ may have other conventions to which we respectfully adhere.

For long-form documents, we prefer sentence case for headings, as we feel this is a better match for our “humble and friendly” voice. Some perceive title case as more formal and a bit too stiff for our tone, so we avoid it in contexts where it’s not required.

In [UI copy](#ui-copy), we capitalize according to the platform conventions, such as Apple’s conventions from the _Human Interface Guidelines_ for [iOS][iOS-HIG] and [OS X][OSX-HIG].

As a general rule, menu commands use title case, but checkboxes and radio buttons use sentence case. See [Use the Right Capitalization Style in Labels and Text](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW4).

### Numbers
In the application, numerals should be used in all cases to save space:
_(1 message pending, 3 conversations, Your password must be at least 6 characters)_.

However, on the website, numbers from one to nine should be spelled out (for example, “there are three ways to download Wire.”)

### Politeness, within reason
We try to sound courteous without being obsequious. While we are not afraid to use “please” or thank you” where applicable, we use these phrases judiciously.

For example, in an initial message in the application, we may ask a user to “Enter a phone number”. If there’s a mistake and we need to generate a second message, this is the time to say: “Please enter a valid phone number”.

### Punctuation
* We do not use periods in most UI strings unless there are two or more sentences. (For example, “Start a conversation”). However, copy on the website should be punctuated correctly.
* We use the serial comma (for example, “Email, phone number, and address”).
* Avoid apostrophes, exclamation marks, ampersands, and the “+” symbol in UI copy.
* Use proper typography for “quotation marks”, em- and en- dashes (–/–), ellipses (…), and other characters wherever possible. (Most UI strings files are now UTF-8 encoded, so typographically correct characters can be used in most cases — there’s no excuse for substituting ASCII text where proper typography is available.)

For complete punctuation rules, we suggest you refer to any good American style guide (_The Chicago Manual of Style_ or _The Yahoo Style Guide_).

### Word choice
Whenever possible, cut unnecessary words. Avoid using too many qualifiers (adjectives, adverbs), modifying clauses and jargon.

Be careful that you don’t bury the action of your sentence in a noun. Instead, take the action out of the noun and put it in the verb format.

## Glossary of Wire terms

See the [draft Glossary on GitHub](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/zeta-glossary.csv).

Feel free to suggest new terms if there’s something missing there.

### German terminology

There's also an initial version of the [German/English glossary](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/Wire-iOS_EN-DE.csv) that you can use to search for the German equivalents of our English terms.

This file was created from the translation memory for the iOS project, so it still contains many long strings and placeholders, but it should give you a good idea of the current German terminology we use.

We're working on integrating a proper multilingual glossary into our Crowdin localization platform, so translators will have access to annotated terminology suggestions within the translation tool.

For a list of multi-touch gesture terms & their German equivalents, see [multi-touch-gestures.csv](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/multi-touch-gestures.csv). These terms are derived from Apple's official German glossary.


## Common usage issues

_(This section complements the Glossary with preferred phrasing & additional explanations for copy issues we find ourselves correcting repeatedly.)_

**For example:** _“in Wire” or “on Wire”?_

We say “in Wire” to mean “in the app”, but “on” is more appropriate when we mean the platform as a whole: “let’s connect on Wire” and “look at the conversation in Wire”.

Easiest to remember as _**in** the app, **on** the plaform_.

### Account references
People _“create an account”_ with Wire — they no longer “join”, “register”, or “sign up”.

They can then “log in” _(two words)_ to their account — _no longer “sign in”_.

**NOTE:** This terminology was changed in December 2015, one year after launch.

People can “log out” of the application and reset their password by selecting options from the … menu in their “Profile”.

### Calls to action
We never ask people to **click here**. Instead we link the key nouns or verbs in the call to action.

### Dates and times
Time indications in conversations are automatically updated and we use timestamps that are relative to the moment, supported by a “casual” writing style (for example, “yesterday”).

Use the following long date format when possible: July 6, 2016.

To avoid ambiguity, do not use 06.07.16, 06/07/2016 or similar formats.

### Icon references
When referring to icons that appear in the user interface, use the name of the action or command that they perform, not the symbol that appears on the button: **Settings** or **Preferences**, not **Gear** or **Cog**.

> “To end the call, tap the Close × icon in the upper left corner of the conversation.”

For an overview of our UI icons, see [User Interface Icon Names](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/UI%20copy%20clients/Zeta%20font/preview_icon_names.pdf?raw=true).

### Preferred spelling variants
* Internet _(capitalized per Apple style guide — see note below)_
* email _(no hyphen)_
* web _(lowercase)_
* webpage _(One word. A self-contained document on a website. A single website can contain many webpages. Don’t use website and webpage interchangeably.)_
* website _(One word. Refers to a collection of webpages.)_
* megapixel
* Wi-Fi _(hyphenated per iOS, OS X & Android)_
* log in / out _(verb: as in “log in to your account” – not “sign in”)_

The default language for Wire copy is U.S. English — so no “u” in “color”, etc.

**NOTE:** In June 2016, the Associated Press and many mainstream newspapers announced they would no longer capitalize “Internet”. Since Apple still uses the capitalized form in iOS and OS X, Wire does the same in UI copy to ensure our app remains consistent with the spelling used in the operating systems.

### Security references
We intentionally leave some elements of our UI copy abstract. This can help to protect users from people with malicious intent (for instance, bots searching for account details).

A good example is the UI error message that tells people they have entered the “wrong address or password”. We may know exactly what’s wrong, but we leave our message vague to stop people from trying to find out if a user account exists.

### Select/choose vs. click/tap/touch
Since people can _(and will)_ interact with Wire across a variety of devices, with a variety of input options (touchscreens, mice, keyboards, etc.), use generic verbs like “select” or “choose” if the content applies to all platforms.

Where the platform context is clear, use the verbs specific to the platform, such as “click”, “tap”, or “touch”.

For more information, see the [Touch Gesture Reference Guide](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1071).

### URLs
Write URLs as wire.com/something, not www.wire.com/something or http://www.wire.com/something.

## Reference resources

In addition to the platform-specific resources described under [UI Copy](#ui-copy), the following resources provide useful reference.

> For guidance on Apple-specific terminology, the writer should refer to the Apple Style Guide. That document covers style and usage issues, and is the key reference for how Apple uses language.

* Apple Style Guide – <https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/>

For complete punctuation rules and other writing conventions, refer to these style guides:

* The Chicago Manual of Style
* The Yahoo Style Guide


# Other communication channels

Beyond the user interface, each of the primary touch-points through which we communicate to our customers may require subtle differences in tone — _how do we talk to our users in each context?_

The sections below outline the unique requirements or guidelines that apply to each channel.
