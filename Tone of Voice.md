## Communication Channels

Each of the primary touch-points through which we communicate to our customers may require subtle differences in tone — _how do we talk to our users in each context?_

The sections below outline the unique requirements or guidelines that apply to each channel:

## Writing Guidelines

> Zeta is different. It's obvious the second you see our application in action. This is a brand that's going to transform the way people communicate.

> Part of that transformation is evident in the way we say what we say. Our communication style underscores our challenger mentality and ensures we deliver a consistent brand experience that's more compelling, more engaging, and more attractive than other options out there.

>Because we believe the way we look and sound on the outside is as important as the sophisticated technology we have on the inside, we've created these guidelines to help you develop people-centered communications that speak with a Zeta 'voice' and follow a certain style.

### Reference Resources

> For guidance on Apple-specific terminology, the writer should refer to the Apple Style Guide. That document covers style and usage issues, and is the key reference for how Apple uses language.

### Glossary of Zeta Terms

See the [draft Glossary on GitHub](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/zeta-glossary.csv).

Feel free to suggest new terms if there's something missing there.


### Common Usage Issues

_(This section complements the Glossary with preferred phrasing & additional explanations for copy issues we find ourselves correcting repeatedly.)_

**For example:** _“in Zeta” or “on Zeta”?_

We say “in Zeta” to mean “in the app”, but “on” is more appropriate when we mean the platform as a whole: ‘let’s connect on Zeta’ and ‘look at the conversation in Zeta’.

Easiest to remember as _**in** the app, **on** the plaform_.

#### Icon References

When referring to icons that appear in the user interface, use the name of the action or command that they perform, not the symbol that appears on the button: **Settings** or **Preferences**, not **Gear** or **Cog**.

> "To end the call, tap the Close × icon in the upper left corner of the conversation."

For an overview of our UI icons, see [User Interface Icon Names](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/UI%20copy%20clients/Zeta%20font/preview_icon_names.pdf?raw=true).


### UI Copy

> Text is prevalent throughout the [user] interface for such things as button names, menu labels, dialog messages, and help tags. Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of UI design.

> In the same way that it’s best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it’s best to work with a professional writer on your app’s user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app’s design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.

#### iOS

> Every word you display in an app is part of a conversation you have with users. Use this conversation as an opportunity to provide clarity and to help people feel comfortable in your app.

### Product Website

### Microsites

_(Web pages accessed via the apps: Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, password change, etc.)_

### Customer Communication

_(signup email, password change, etc.)_

### Customer Support Material

_(based on feedback from Support ToV discussion w/ founders)_

Examples of the language we currently use to describe the Zeta product feeling:

* Elegant
* Clean
* Beautiful
* Simple
* Minimalist
* Efficient
* Pristine
* Modern
* Mobile

Like the product, our support communications should be clear, technically correct, concise, precise, and straightforward.

Special considerations for Support content:

* Support is addressing users who may be – publicly – frustrated or dissatisfied with their experience. Different level of attention we need to display.
* “Winning over” vs. “regaining” trust.
* Our users are networked and opinionated:  their experiences will be “televised”

When is Customer Support great?

1. Pro-active problem solving
2. Humble, friendly, polite attitude/ToV
3. Explain in “humanese”/“personal” touch
4. Demonstrated understanding of u/x
   “take the time to hear/ solve your issue”
