# UI copy

> Text is prevalent throughout the [user] interface for such things as button names, menu labels, dialog messages, and help tags. Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of UI design.

> In the same way that it’s best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it’s best to work with a professional writer on your app’s user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app’s design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.

— Apple _OS X Human Interface Guidelines_


## Mac OS X (desktop)

When writing for the Mac desktop user interface, use the conventions that Apple has established in the [OS X Human Interface Guidelines][OSX-HIG].

The following sections are particularly useful:

* [Naming Menus and Items](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/MenuNaming.html)
* [Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html)
* [Use the Right Capitalization Style in Labels and Text](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW4)

**NOTE:** In June, Apple announced that their desktop operating system will be renamed from “OS X” to “macOS” with Version 10.12 (Sierra). 

However, since _OS X El Capitan_ (Version 10.11) is still the current version, we’ll stick with the “OS X” terminology until the new version ships this fall. Once _macOS Sierra_ is released, we’ll change all occurrences to reflect the official name of the new “macOS”.

## iOS

When writing for iOS, refer to the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines][iOS-HIG], especially:

* [Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/FeedbackCommunication.html)
* [UI Elements](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html)

## Android

For guidance on writing conventions for Android, see [Android Writing Style](https://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html).


# Writing guidelines

> Wire is different. It’s obvious the second you see our application in action. This is a brand that’s going to transform the way people communicate.

> Part of that transformation is evident in the way we say what we say. Our communication style underscores our challenger mentality and ensures we deliver a consistent brand experience that’s more compelling, more engaging, and more attractive than other options out there.

>Because we believe the way we look and sound on the outside is as important as the sophisticated technology we have on the inside, we’ve created these guidelines to help you develop people-centered communications that speak with a Wire “voice” and follow our style.


## Our tone of voice

Communicating our core brand values - people, craft and evolution - requires a tone of voice that is consistent at every level, yet is still flexible enough to accommodate a variety of audiences.

By speaking with a consistent voice, we ensure a seamless experience wherever people might encounter our brand, whether that’s creating user interface text in the application, an email verifying a new account, or a registration page on the website.

Think of it this way – if Wire was a person, he or she would be smart, driven and personable and those characteristics would hold true in any situation.

To ensure we reach that level of consistency across all our brand touchpoints, we must ensure our tone of voice is:

* **Contemporary** – we use contractions when it’s called for, and we may even take a few language liberties (such as starting a sentence with a conjunction or using incomplete sentences when short and to the point will do: “Forgot your password?” instead of “Did you forget your password?”). But, we avoid jargon and slang that might be “in” today but could be “out” tomorrow.
* **Direct** - we communicate in straightforward, confident language that is as honest and transparent as possible (for example, “You’ll need to add contacts before you can start a conversation” instead of “We need access to your address book to find people to start a conversation”).
* **Personable** – our words create the impression of one person (“we” at Wire) speaking with another (“you” the reader) as a friend, not a faceless “user”. However, the emphasis should always be on “you”, with less “we” or “us”.
* **Supportive** – we never blame; rather, we always offer a helpful solution or suggest a next step (for example, “Forgot your password? Retrieve it here...”, not simply an error message highlighting the obvious: “That’s the wrong password” with no link).
* **Concise** – we use active verbs whenever possible (for example, “Sami muted this conversation”, not “This conversation was muted by Sami”) and always opt for imperatives before gerunds (for example, “Use this code to link your phone”, not “Using this code will link your phone”).
* **Polite** – we’re not afraid to say “please or thank you” in instructional copy and calls to action, but we don’t overdo it and we sometimes use it to (gently) remind people.


## Our writing style

### Abbreviations
Avoid abbreviations where possible. Use “for example” or “such as” instead of “e.g.” or “that is” instead of “i.e.”. – or, better yet – edit copy to avoid these constructs entirely.

### Articles, leading or otherwise
In all UI copy, we avoid articles wherever possible. Articles include “a”, “an”, “the”, etc. In a similar vein, we also avoid demonstrative words such as “this” and “those”.

### Capitalization
We use all caps for system messages (“UNBLOCK”) in the conversation view and in certain other places as necessary to agree with (Android) platform conventions.

However, for longer phrases or sentences, we use sentence case: we only capitalize the first word of a phrase or sentence (“You’ve left this conversation”).

Headings on the website, support site, and longer documents should use case consistently _(either sentence case or title case)_ based on context.

For example, CS content at [support.wire.com](https://support.wire.com/) uses sentence case in the question list, but title case in page headings _(as required by the Zendesk customer service platform)_. Certain channels _(such as press releases)_ may have other conventions to which we respectfully adhere.

For long-form documents, we prefer sentence case for headings, as we feel this is a better match for our “humble and friendly” voice. Some perceive title case as more formal and a bit too stiff for our tone, so we avoid it in contexts where it’s not required.

In [UI copy](#ui-copy), we capitalize according to the platform conventions, such as Apple’s conventions from the _Human Interface Guidelines_ for [iOS][iOS-HIG] and [OS X][OSX-HIG].

As a general rule, menu commands use title case, but checkboxes and radio buttons use sentence case. See [Use the Right Capitalization Style in Labels and Text](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW4).

### Numbers / numerals
In the application, numerals should be used in all cases to save space:
_(1 message pending, 3 conversations, Your password must be at least 6 characters)_.

However, on the website, numbers from one to nine should be spelled out (for example, there are three ways to download the Wire application...)

### Politeness, within reason
We try to sound courteous without being obsequious. While we are not afraid to use “please” or thank you” where applicable, we use these phrases judiciously.

For example, in an initial message in the application, we may ask a user to: “Enter a phone number”. If there’s a mistake and we need to generate a second message, this is the time to say: “Please enter a valid phone number”.

### Punctuation
* We do not use full stops in most UI strings (for example, “Start a conversation”). However, copy on the website should be punctuated correctly.
* We use the serial comma (for example, “Email, phone number, and address”).
* Apostrophes. Use the normal possessive ending ’s after singular words or names that end in s. Use it after plurals that do not end in s: women’s, media’s. Use the ending s’ on plurals that end in s: Partners’.
* Avoid! Exclamation! Marks!
* Avoid the ampersand and the “+” symbol unless it is part of a brand name (P&G).
* Dynamic messages in the Wire application should not end with a period. The exception would be if there were two or more sentences.
    **For example:** Your phone number isn’t mandatory, but it makes it easier for us to find people you know. For security, we’ll send a code to verify your number.

For complete punctuation rules, we suggest you refer to any good American style guide (_The Chicago Manual of Style_ or _The Yahoo Style Guide_).


## Glossary of Wire terms

See the [draft Glossary on GitHub](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/zeta-glossary.csv).

Feel free to suggest new terms if there’s something missing there.

### German terminology

There's also an initial version of the [German/English glossary](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/Wire-iOS_EN-DE.csv) that you can use to search for the German equivalents of our English terms.

This file was created from the translation memory for the iOS project, so it still contains many long strings and placeholders, but it should give you a good idea of the current German terminology we use.

We're working on integrating a proper multilingual glossary into our Crowdin localization platform, so translators will have access to annotated terminology suggestions within the translation tool.

For a list of multi-touch gesture terms & their German equivalents, see [multi-touch-gestures.csv](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/Glossary/multi-touch-gestures.csv). These terms are derived from Apple's official German glossary.

## Creating web content

Web readers have learned to read text on web pages differently than on a printed page. Usability studies have proven that when people read online, they quickly become adept at scanning through a document, looking for key words or phrases that will give them cues about the subject matter.

Eye-tracking studies of people reading information pages have shown that many web readers often adopt an F-shaped reading strategy – skimming across the first few sections or titles at the top of a page, then down the left-hand side.

In addition, web readers are looking for relevant information sooner, rather than later. Give people relevant content up front and they’ll feel satisfied and possibly keep reading.

Finally, to create effective web copy, you need to ensure your content makes sense out of context. As the reader may land on your page via a search engine, without having navigated through a particular route, they should be able to understand each page or section of your document whether they read the previous sections or pages or not.

### Length
On the web, brevity is king. This applies to sentences, paragraphs and overall article length. In most cases, the 50 percent rule applies: Cut 25 percent and then cut 25 percent more. Leave readers with the highlights.

### Sentences
Try to keep your sentences short. Split lengthy sentences into shorter ones. Make sure each sentence has one thought – or two tightly connected thoughts. Very short sentences are acceptable, particularly in a question and answer format, where a short answer may be all that you need.

### Paragraphs
Using shorter paragraphs (or “chunks”) makes scanning much easier. A paragraph should contain a single concept or idea. The shorter a paragraph, the more focused it will be.

A one-sentence paragraph is perfectly acceptable on the web.

Pace is important. Consider mixing short sentences (like the last one) with longer ones (like this one).

Here’s a tip for generating shorter, more succinct copy: Read your document once. Then go back and choose key phrases that summarize each sentence or paragraph. Make key phrases bold.

While you won’t keep this bold text in your final web page, the process of identifying a single phrase within a sentence or paragraph will help you focus your writing.

You will quickly find this exercise forces you to re-write sentences to deliver key phrases with fewer words. This will also help you avoid unclear or ambiguous sentences. Remember that brevity should never come at the expense of clarity.

### Instructional copy and messaging
Clear and concise copy that guides readers is critical to satisfying their experience on our pages. After all, our users want to achieve particular goals and instructional copy is what will guide them along the way.

* Use the active voice
* Limit number of words
* Address each action clearly
* Stay focused on the specific action or task
* Remove irrelevant information


### Headings
As readers skip, skim and scan your pages, they often only notice the first two or three words of any of the paragraphs on the page. They also pay more attention to headings, bulleted lists and links, so it is important to ensure the first two or three words in those items “front load” information as much as possible.

The best web headings should:

* Let the reader know what they will find on the page
* Immediately communicate facts
* Be creative, interesting, short, to the point and written in plain, active language * Avoid puns, teasers and cultural references;
* Skip leading articles (“a”, “the”, etc.)

We prefer sentence case for headings (see [Capitalization](#capitalization)).

#### Sub-headings
People scan web pages using both headings and subheadings. To help your reader’s eyes move down the page, try to break body text into sections. Then write sub-headings for each section.

### Links
Scanning links is another way that readers might navigate your content.

The best links should:

* Use plain language that does not mislead or promise too much
* Use specific terminology
* Allow readers to predict (with a fair degree of confidence) what they will get if they click;
* Follow conventions for naming common features (for example, “Read more”, “Next/Previous”, etc.)
* Front-load user- and action-oriented terms at the beginning of the link (for example, “Download our app”).

#### Links: What not to do
Be careful not to create too many links, especially within your body copy. Excess links can be distracting - people feel compelled to click. When they do, they often lose their train of thought and some never return to the original page, despite not having absorbed all the information it contains.

Never use “Click here” or “More” to push readers to another page of content. These terms suggest lazy writing, and they are particularly annoying to people using screen-reader software to “hear” your page.

To avoid “Click here”, you can turn your titles or key messages into links (for example, “Learn more about seamless conversations”).

To avoid “More”, you can add words to specify exactly what readers will be getting “more” of, or you can use informative words as the link (for example, “More tips for using Wire”).

**Note:** Slogans that act as links (for example, “Start the conversation”) do not take a full stop. However, you should use a full stop after a link if it ends the sentence (more applicable to web writing than the UI).

### List items
Lists are another great way to help readers absorb your information quickly.

Lists should be short – between 5 to 10 items. If your list is too long, try breaking it up into several lists, each with their own heading or introduction. Obviously, long lists are acceptable for familiar items such as countries.

In general, bulleted lists should contain relatively few words or short phrases. If the bulleted items are long, they should be clearly separated to prevent your page from becoming a wall of words.


## Common usage issues

_(This section complements the Glossary with preferred phrasing & additional explanations for copy issues we find ourselves correcting repeatedly.)_

**For example:** _“in Wire” or “on Wire”?_

We say “in Wire” to mean “in the app”, but “on” is more appropriate when we mean the platform as a whole: “let’s connect on Wire” and “look at the conversation in Wire”.

Easiest to remember as _**in** the app, **on** the plaform_.

### Account references
People _“create an account”_ with Wire — they no longer “join”, “register”, or “sign up”. 

They can then “log in” _(two words)_ to their account — _no longer “sign in”_.

**NOTE:** This terminology was changed in December 2015, one year after launch.

People can “log out” of the application and reset their password by selecting options from the … menu in their “Profile”. However, any other maintenance activities will usually take place in the interface itself, as and when the user needs it.

### Calls to action
We never ask people to **click here**. Instead we link the key nouns or verbs in the call to action.

### Dates and times
Time indications in conversations are automatically updated and we use timestamps that are relative to the moment, supported by a “casual” writing style (for example, “yesterday”). When not updated automatically, avoid “now”, “new”, “today”, “tomorrow” and other similar time sensitive words that will be wrong a day later.

Do not use “once” to indicate a past occurrence, such as “Once the image is uploaded...”. Use “After you’ve uploaded your image” or “After your image upload is complete”.

Use the following long date format when possible: September 8, 2005.

_(The shortened form is acceptable using the first three letters of the month)_.

To avoid ambiguity, do not use 08.08.05, 08/08/2005 or variations.

### Icon references
When referring to icons that appear in the user interface, use the name of the action or command that they perform, not the symbol that appears on the button: **Settings** or **Preferences**, not **Gear** or **Cog**.

> “To end the call, tap the Close × icon in the upper left corner of the conversation.”

For an overview of our UI icons, see [User Interface Icon Names](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/UI%20copy%20clients/Zeta%20font/preview_icon_names.pdf?raw=true).

### Preferred spelling variants
* Internet _(capitalized per Apple style guide)_
* email _(no hyphen)_
* web _(lowercase)_
* webpage _(One word. A self-contained document on a website. A single website can contain many webpages. Don’t use website and webpage interchangeably.)_
* website _(One word. Refers to a collection of webpages.)_
* megapixel
* Wi-Fi _(hyphenated per iOS, OS X & Android)_
* log in / out _(verb: as in “log in to your account” – not “sign in”)_

The default language for Wire copy is U.S. English — so no “u” in “color”, etc.

### Security references
We intentionally leave some elements of our UI copy abstract. This can help to protect users from people with malicious intent (for instance, bots searching for account details).

A good example is the UI error message that tells people they have entered the “wrong address or password”. We may know exactly what’s wrong, but we leave our message vague to stop people from trying to find out if a user account exists.

### Select/choose vs. click/tap/touch
Since people can _(and will)_ interact with Wire across a variety of devices, with a variety of input options (touchscreens, mice, keyboards, etc.), use generic verbs like “select” or “choose” if the content applies to all platforms.

Where the platform context is clear, use the verbs specific to the platform, such as “click”, “tap”, or “touch”.

For more information, see the [Touch Gesture Reference Guide](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1071).

### URLs
URLs are written as wire.com/something, not www.wire.com/something or http://www.wire.com/something.

### Word choice
Whenever possible, cut unnecessary words. The table below shows examples of shorter words that help make sentences more concise:

| Wordy                         | Better    |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| due to the fact that          | because   |
| for the reason that           | because   |
| in the event that             | if        |
| at this point in time         | now       |
| in a great many instances     | often     |
| situated in the vicinity of   | near      |
| during the same time that     | while     |
| in the not too distant future | soon      |
| prior to the time that        | before    |
| in such a manner as to        | to        |
| for a period of               | for       |
| connect up together           | join      |

Avoid using too many qualifiers (adjectives, adverbs), modifying clauses and jargon.

Be careful that you don’t bury the action of your sentence in a noun. Instead, take the action out of the noun and put it in the verb format.

Examples of the most common nouns that hide verbs:

| Noun           | Should be this verb |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| denial         | deny                |
| maintenance    | maintain, keep up   |
| concurrence    | concur, agree       |
| assignment     | assign              |
| failure        | fail, if you don’t  |
| transmission   | transmit, send      |
| recommendation | recommend           |


## Reference resources

In addition to the platform-specific resources described under [UI Copy](#ui-copy), the following resources provide useful reference.

> For guidance on Apple-specific terminology, the writer should refer to the Apple Style Guide. That document covers style and usage issues, and is the key reference for how Apple uses language.

* Apple Style Guide – <https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/>

For complete punctuation rules and other writing conventions, refer to these style guides:

* The Chicago Manual of Style
* The Yahoo Style Guide


# Other communication channels

Beyond the user interface, each of the primary touch-points through which we communicate to our customers may require subtle differences in tone — _how do we talk to our users in each context?_

The sections below outline the unique requirements or guidelines that apply to each channel.


## Customer Support material

_(based on feedback from Support ToV discussion w/ founders)_

Examples of the language we currently use to describe the Wire product feeling:

* Elegant
* Clean
* Beautiful
* Simple
* Minimalist
* Efficient
* Pristine
* Modern
* Mobile

Like the product, our support communications should be clear, technically correct, concise, precise, and straightforward.

Special considerations for Support content:

* Support is addressing users who may be – publicly – frustrated or dissatisfied with their experience. Different level of attention we need to display.
* “Winning over” vs. “regaining” trust.
* Our users are networked and opinionated: their experiences will be “televised”

When is Customer Support great?

1. Pro-active problem solving
2. Humble, friendly, polite attitude/ToV
3. Explain in “humanese”/“personal” touch
4. Demonstrated understanding of u/x
   “take the time to hear/ solve your issue”


## Product website

Text on the website at [wire.com](https://www.wire.com/) is kept to a minimum and makes liberal use of periods to punctuate our claims _(even sentence fragments)_:

> Introducing Wire. Great conversations.

> Talk.  
> It sounds truly amazing.

> Message.  
> With pics, SoundCloud and YouTube.

> Ping.  
> Get attention, without the ring.

> Wire is here.  
> For iOS. For Android. For OS X.

## Microsites

_(Web pages accessed via the apps: Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, password change, etc.)_

## Customer communication (email)

_(signup email, password change, etc.)_

## Marketing material

## App Store copy
