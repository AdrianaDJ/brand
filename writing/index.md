The way we look and sound on the outside is as important as the sophisticated technology we have on the inside, so we’ve created these guidelines to help you develop content that speaks with a Wire “voice” and follows our style.

<p class="lead">
  Humble and friendly. <br>
  Curious and passionate. <br>
  Witty and polite. <br>
  Energetic and fresh. <br>
  Stylish and understated.
</p>

<p class="lead dark">That’s Wire.</p>
