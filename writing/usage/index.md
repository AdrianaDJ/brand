## Common usage issues

### In/on Wire

We say “in Wire” to mean “in the app”, but “on” is more appropriate when we mean the platform as a whole: “let’s connect on Wire” and “look at the conversation in Wire”.

Easiest to remember as _**in** the app, **on** the plaform_.

### Account references
People _“create an account”_ with Wire — they no longer “join”, “register”, or “sign up”.

They can then “log in” _(two words)_ to their account — _no longer “sign in”_.

**NOTE:** This terminology was changed in December 2015, one year after launch.

People can “log out” of the application and reset their password by selecting options from the … menu in their “Profile”.

### Calls to action
We never ask people to **click here**. Instead we link the key nouns or verbs in the call to action.

### Dates and times
Time indications in conversations are automatically updated and we use timestamps that are relative to the moment, supported by a “casual” writing style (for example, “yesterday”).

Use the following long date format when possible: July 6, 2016.

To avoid ambiguity, do not use 06.07.16, 06/07/2016 or similar formats.

### Icon references
When referring to icons that appear in the user interface, use the name of the action or command that they perform, not the symbol that appears on the button: **Settings** or **Preferences**, not **Gear** or **Cog**.

> “To end the call, tap the Close × icon in the upper left corner of the conversation.”

For an overview of our UI icons, see [User Interface Icon Names](https://github.com/wearezeta/copywriting/blob/master/UI%20copy%20clients/Zeta%20font/preview_icon_names.pdf?raw=true).

### Preferred spelling variants
* Internet _(capitalized per Apple style guide — see note below)_
* email _(no hyphen)_
* web _(lowercase)_
* webpage _(One word. A self-contained document on a website. A single website can contain many webpages. Don’t use website and webpage interchangeably.)_
* website _(One word. Refers to a collection of webpages.)_
* megapixel
* Wi-Fi _(hyphenated per iOS, OS X & Android)_
* log in / out _(verb: as in “log in to your account” – not “sign in”)_

The default language for Wire copy is U.S. English — so no “u” in “color”, etc.

**NOTE:** In June 2016, the Associated Press and many mainstream newspapers announced they would no longer capitalize “Internet”. Since Apple still uses the capitalized form in iOS and OS X, Wire does the same in UI copy to ensure our app remains consistent with the spelling used in the operating systems.

### Security references
We intentionally leave some elements of our UI copy abstract. This can help to protect users from people with malicious intent (for instance, bots searching for account details).

A good example is the UI error message that tells people they have entered the “wrong address or password”. We may know exactly what’s wrong, but we leave our message vague to stop people from trying to find out if a user account exists.

### Select/choose vs. click/tap/touch
Since people can _(and will)_ interact with Wire across a variety of devices, with a variety of input options (touchscreens, mice, keyboards, etc.), use generic verbs like “select” or “choose” if the content applies to all platforms.

Where the platform context is clear, use the verbs specific to the platform, such as “click”, “tap”, or “touch”.

For more information, see the [Touch Gesture Reference Guide](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1071).

### URLs
Write URLs beginning with the **wire.com** domain, and without the trailing slash — _most modern browsers will add this automatically if necessary_.

For example, write _wire.com/privacy_, instead of:

* wire.com/privacy**/**
* ~~www.~~wire.com/privacy
* ~~http://www.~~wire.com/privacy
