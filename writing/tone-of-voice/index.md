## Tone of voice

Communicating our core brand values - people, craft and evolution - requires a tone of voice that is consistent at every level, yet is still flexible enough to accommodate a variety of audiences.

By speaking with a consistent voice, we ensure a seamless experience wherever people might encounter our brand, whether that’s creating user interface text in the application, an email verifying a new account, or a registration page on the website.

Think of it this way – if Wire was a person, he or she would be smart, driven and personable and those characteristics would hold true in any situation.

To ensure we reach that level of consistency across all our brand touchpoints, we must ensure our tone of voice is:

* **Contemporary** – we use contractions when it’s called for, and we may even take a few language liberties (such as starting a sentence with a conjunction or using incomplete sentences when short and to the point will do: “Forgot your password?” instead of “Did you forget your password?”). But, we avoid jargon and slang that might be “in” today but could be “out” tomorrow.
* **Direct** - we communicate in straightforward, confident language that is as honest and transparent as possible (for example, “You’ll need to add contacts before you can start a conversation” instead of “We need access to your address book to find people to start a conversation”).
* **Personable** – our words create the impression of one person (“we” at Wire) speaking with another (“you” the reader) as a friend, not a faceless “user”. However, the emphasis should always be on “you”, with less “we” or “us”.
* **Supportive** – we never blame; rather, we always offer a helpful solution or suggest a next step (for example, “Forgot your password? Retrieve it here…”, not simply an error message highlighting the obvious: “That’s the wrong password” with no link).
* **Concise** – we use active verbs whenever possible (for example, “Sami muted this conversation”, not “This conversation was muted by Sami”) and always opt for imperatives before gerunds (for example, “Use this code to link your phone”, not “Using this code will link your phone”).
* **Polite** – we’re not afraid to say “please or thank you” in instructional copy and calls to action, but we don’t overdo it and we sometimes use it to (gently) remind people.
