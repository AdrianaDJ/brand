## User interface text

Text appears in the user interface _(or “UI”)_ in button names, menu labels, application settings, dialog messages, and notification banners.

The care we take in crafting every bit of text _(or “microcopy”)_ in the app should reflect the level of detail invested in the overall application design and user experience that sets Wire apart.

> In the same way that it’s best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it’s best to work with a professional writer on your app’s user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app’s design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.

— Apple _OS X Human Interface Guidelines_

Rather than re-invent the wheel or get “creative” in ways that confuse users, we defer to existing platform conventions wherever possible.

The sections below provide resources for each platform we support.

## Mac OS X (desktop)

When writing for the Mac desktop user interface, use the conventions that Apple has established in the [OS X Human Interface Guidelines][OSX-HIG].

The following sections are particularly useful:

* [Naming Menus and Items](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/MenuNaming.html)
* [Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html)
* [Use the Right Capitalization Style in Labels and Text](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW4)

**NOTE:** In June, Apple announced that their desktop operating system will be renamed from “OS X” to “macOS” with Version 10.12 (Sierra).

However, since _OS X El Capitan_ (Version 10.11) is still the current version, we’ll stick with the “OS X” terminology until the new version ships this fall. Once _macOS Sierra_ is released, we’ll change all occurrences to reflect the official name of the new “macOS”.

## iOS

When writing for iOS, refer to the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines][iOS-HIG], especially:

* [Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/FeedbackCommunication.html)
* [UI Elements](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html)

## Android

For guidance on writing conventions for Android, see [Android Writing Style](https://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html).

Feel free to suggest new terms if there’s something missing there.
